![emma]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/emma.png)<br><br>| **Emma Derrick**<br>Research interests: Most of our current knowledge of bacterial evolution comes from laboratory experiments. I am interested in how bacteria evolve in a semi-natural aquatic community where bacteria can interact with each other and their environment. Using [LEAP](https://qcbs.ca/qcbs-research-showcase?showcase_id=35) at McGill Gault Nature Reserve, we are studying the evolutionary responses of bacteria after herbicide contamination.<br>Background: I completed my B.Sc. at McGill University in Microbiology and Immunology. During my undergrad I joined the Shapiro lab and worked on a project on susceptibility to cholera infection using metagenomes.<br><br>
![akhil]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/akhil.png)<br><br>| **Akhil Kholwadwala**<br>Research Interests: For my PhD, using the [LEAP](https://qcbs.ca/qcbs-research-showcase?showcase_id=35) system as a model, I am interested in the rapid adaptation of aquatic communities and individual species to a plurality of anthropogenic stressors and their synergistic effects. I am also interested in looking at the predictability of evolution within the context of this system.<br>Previous Research: I graduated with a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a B.A. in French from the University of Rochester in 2022. As an undergraduate, I conducted research with Dr. Jennifer Brisson on the evolution of polymorphic and polyphenic traitsin aphids. I also worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to test the ability of eDNA technologies to detect the presence of rare and endangered bumblebee species.<br><br>
![chuhan]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/chuhan.jpeg)<br><br>| **Chuhan Qin**<br>Research interests: For my PhD, I would like to understand how the interaction of different biological processes such as selection, mutation and recombination has resulted in different population structures in different bacteria. Built upon this, I want to develop novel population genomic models that can be used to predict population dynamics and guide the clinical usage of drugs.<br>Previous research: The first project I worked on is with Prof. Stephen Gordon, during which I used whole genome sequencing data to trace the transmission of *Mycobacterium avium* in cows from several Irish farms.  I then moved on to work with Prof. Matthew Fisher on a population genomics study of the pathogenic fungus *Aspergillus fumigatus*, and with Dr Nicholas Croucher exploring the mechanisms controlling the population structure of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Helicobacter pylori*.<br><br>
