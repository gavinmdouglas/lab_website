![emma]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/emma.png)<br><br>| **Emma Derrick**<br>_Research interests_: Most of our current knowledge of bacterial evolution comes from laboratory experiments. I am interested in how bacteria evolve in a semi-natural aquatic community where bacteria can interact with each other and their environment. Using [LEAP](https://qcbs.ca/qcbs-research-showcase?showcase_id=35) at McGill Gault Nature Reserve, we are studying the evolutionary responses of bacteria after herbicide contamination.<br>_Background_: I completed my B.Sc. at McGill University in Microbiology and Immunology. During my undergrad I joined the Shapiro lab and worked on a project on susceptibility to cholera infection using metagenomes.<br><br>
![akhil]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/akhil.png)<br><br>| **Akhil Kholwadwala**<br>_Research Interests_: For my PhD, using the [LEAP](https://qcbs.ca/qcbs-research-showcase?showcase_id=35) system as a model, I am interested in the rapid adaptation of aquatic communities and individual species to a plurality of anthropogenic stressors and their synergistic effects. I am also interested in looking at the predictability of evolution within the context of this system.<br>_Previous Research_: I graduated with a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a B.A. in French from the University of Rochester in 2022. As an undergraduate, I conducted research with Dr. Jennifer Brisson on the evolution of polymorphic and polyphenic traitsin aphids. I also worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to test the ability of eDNA technologies to detect the presence of rare and endangered bumblebee species.<br><br>
![chuhan]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/chuhan.jpeg)<br><br>| **Chuhan Qin**<br>_Research interests_: For my PhD, I would like to understand how the interaction of different biological processes such as selection, mutation and recombination has resulted in different population structures in different bacteria. Built upon this, I want to develop novel population genomic models that can be used to predict population dynamics and guide the clinical usage of drugs.<br>_Previous research_: The first project I worked on is with Prof. Stephen Gordon, during which I used whole genome sequencing data to trace the transmission of *Mycobacterium avium* in cows from several Irish farms.  I then moved on to work with Prof. Matthew Fisher on a population genomics study of the pathogenic fungus *Aspergillus fumigatus*, and with Dr Nicholas Croucher exploring the mechanisms controlling the population structure of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Helicobacter pylori*.<br><br>

![nico]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/nico.jpeg)<br><br>| [**Nicolas Tromas**](https://nicolastromascyano.weebly.com)<br>_Research interests_: My main interests are to solve fundamental questions in microbial ecology and evolution; tracking evolving microbial populations in real time, using whole-genome and whole-community DNA sequencing to understand their evolution and predict how they adapt to changing environments. One of my objectives is to improve prediction of cyanobacterial blooms and toxicity using microbial interaction information. One of my favorite things is to connect with people and develop new projects.<br>_Background_: I did my PhD with Santiago F. Elena at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain where I used the plant virus TEV as a model to address evolutionary questions. And after? To make it short: I moved to Montréal in 2014 to work on Cyanobacteria with Jesse - was a Marie S. Curie fellow with Angus Buckling and Jesse - worked (and still working on!!) one of the biggest Cyano genomics project (ATRAPP) - currently working with Sam Chaffron (LS2N, Nantes) on Tara oceans data - and reducing my stress by writing volume 2 of Fila&Bubbee (children's book).<br><br>
