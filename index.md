**News** - Winter 2023 

1. Naima's paper "Community diversity is associated with intra-species genetic diversity and gene loss in the human gut microbiome" is now out in [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/78530). This was a fun collaboration with the [Garud lab](https://bioscience.ucla.edu/people/nandita-garud/). Read more about it in this [thread](https://twitter.com/bjesseshapiro/status/1623759198516305920?s=20).
2. Gavin's paper "Efficient computation of contributional diversity metrics from microbiome data with *FuncDiv*." is out in [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac809). Read all about it in Gavin's [thread](https://twitter.com/gavin_m_douglas/status/1622951069293903874?s=20).
3. We are thrilled to have [Dr. Aline Cu√©nod](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6OxAByoAAAAJ&hl=en) join the lab!
