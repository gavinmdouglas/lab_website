![emma]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/emma.png)<br><br>| **Emma Derrick**<br>_Research interests_: Most of our current knowledge of bacterial evolution comes from laboratory experiments. I am interested in how bacteria evolve in a semi-natural aquatic community where bacteria can interact with each other and their environment. Using [LEAP](https://qcbs.ca/qcbs-research-showcase?showcase_id=35) at McGill Gault Nature Reserve, we are studying the evolutionary responses of bacteria after herbicide contamination.<br>_Background_: I completed my B.Sc. at McGill University in Microbiology and Immunology. During my undergrad I joined the Shapiro lab and worked on a project on susceptibility to cholera infection using metagenomes.<br><br>
![akhil]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/akhil.png)<br><br>| **Akhil Kholwadwala**<br>_Research Interests_: For my PhD, using the [LEAP](https://qcbs.ca/qcbs-research-showcase?showcase_id=35) system as a model, I am interested in the rapid adaptation of aquatic communities and individual species to a plurality of anthropogenic stressors and their synergistic effects. I am also interested in looking at the predictability of evolution within the context of this system.<br>_Previous Research_: I graduated with a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a B.A. in French from the University of Rochester in 2022. As an undergraduate, I conducted research with Dr. Jennifer Brisson on the evolution of polymorphic and polyphenic traitsin aphids. I also worked with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to test the ability of eDNA technologies to detect the presence of rare and endangered bumblebee species.<br><br>
![chuhan]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/chuhan.jpeg)<br><br>| **Chuhan Qin**<br>_Research interests_: For my PhD, I would like to understand how the interaction of different biological processes such as selection, mutation and recombination has resulted in different population structures in different bacteria. Built upon this, I want to develop novel population genomic models that can be used to predict population dynamics and guide the clinical usage of drugs.<br>_Previous research_: The first project I worked on is with Prof. Stephen Gordon, during which I used whole genome sequencing data to trace the transmission of *Mycobacterium avium* in cows from several Irish farms.  I then moved on to work with Prof. Matthew Fisher on a population genomics study of the pathogenic fungus *Aspergillus fumigatus*, and with Dr Nicholas Croucher exploring the mechanisms controlling the population structure of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Helicobacter pylori*.<br><br>

![nico]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/nico.jpeg)<br><br>| [**Nicolas Tromas**](https://nicolastromascyano.weebly.com)<br>_Research interests_: My main interests are to solve fundamental questions in microbial ecology and evolution; tracking evolving microbial populations in real time, using whole-genome and whole-community DNA sequencing to understand their evolution and predict how they adapt to changing environments. One of my objectives is to improve prediction of cyanobacterial blooms and toxicity using microbial interaction information. One of my favorite things is to connect with people and develop new projects.<br>_Background_: I did my PhD with Santiago F. Elena at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain where I used the plant virus TEV as a model to address evolutionary questions. And after? To make it short: I moved to Montréal in 2014 to work on Cyanobacteria with Jesse - was a Marie S. Curie fellow with Angus Buckling and Jesse - worked (and still working on!!) one of the biggest Cyano genomics project (ATRAPP) - currently working with Sam Chaffron (LS2N, Nantes) on Tara oceans data - and reducing my stress by writing volume 2 of Fila&Bubbee (children's book).<br><br>
![aline]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/aline.jpeg)<br><br>| **Aline Cuénod**<br>_Research interests_: I am fascinated by infectious diseases and the interplay of pathogenic bacteria with their human host. Cholera is one of the most important infectious diseases, yearly affecting millions of people and frequently arising where sanitary infrastructure is inadequate. Pandemic cholera is caused by a pathogenic lineage of the aquatic bacterial species *V. cholerae.* While *V. cholerae* infections can be very virulent and lead to severe dehydration and death within hours, most infections cause no or only mild diarrhoeal symptoms. In my current project, for which I received a Postdoc.Mobility fellowship from the Swiss National Science Foundation, I investigate the interplay of patient characteristics and bacterial genetic factors promoting Cholera symptoms and transmission.<br>_Background_: During my PhD, which I did in the research group of Prof. Adrian Egli at the University of Basel (Switzerland), I worked in close collaboration with clinical diagnostics. I analysed Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra, bacterial genomes and patient related clinical data, to increase the resolution of bacterial identification in diagnostics for *Klebsiella* and *E. coli*.<br><br>
![gavin]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/gavin.jpeg)<br><br>| [**Gavin Douglas**](https://www.gavindouglas.ca)<br>_Research interests_: I study a broad range of questions related to microbial evolutionary genetics. Currently I am focused on applying standard population genetics approaches to prokaryotic strains found in natural communities. I would like to leverage this approach to assess the strength of selection acting on accessory genes across different strains. This work is currently focused on strains found in the honey bee gut microbiome, which has low taxonomic richness and so somewhat simplifies the task of profiling strain-level variation. I am also interested more generally in the importance of gene-level vs. individual-level selection in shaping prokaryotic pangenomes.<br>_Background_: I did my PhD at Dalhousie University with Morgan Langille, where my work focused on integrating functional and taxonomic data types for microbiome data analysis. Prior to that, I worked as a bioinformatician for a year at the Integrated Microbiome Resource at Dalhousie University. I completed my BSc and MSc degrees both at the University of Toronto. I worked with Alan Moses during my MSc project, which involved investigating the evolutionary forces acting upon primate transcription factor binding sites.<br><br>
![steven]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/steven.png)<br><br>| **Steven G. Sutcliffe**<br>_Research interests_: Wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) has been used to track pathogens circulating in the community (e.g., Polio in the UK) and is receiving more interest than ever with SARS-CoV-2 being efficiently tracked in wastewater across the globe. My interest is in both understanding how to improve SARS-CoV-2 monitoring for WBE, and in how these tools can improve our pandemic preparedness beyond SARS-CoV-2. In the Shapiro Lab we are working on building the bioinformatic infrastructure to efficiently handle the large-quantities of sequence data from WBE, and its translation to inform public health.<br>_Background_: I received a PhD from McGill in Microbiology and Immunology for my work in the lab of Dr. Corinne Maurice. My thesis was on the role of bacteriophages (viruses of bacteria) in shaping the human gut microbiota. We showed that phages persist in the healthy human gut through integrating within the bacterial genome but this balance can be disrupted by exposure to various medications. Prior to that I had worked in food safety microbiology laboratory (Mérieux NutriSciences), and did research on diatoms (microalgae) in the laboratory of Dr. Irena Kaczmarska at Mount Allison University. It is a microbial world, we just live in it! <br><br>
