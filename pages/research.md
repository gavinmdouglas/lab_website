Most of the genetic and metabolic diversity that exists on earth – and has existed for billions of years – is microbial. Arguably more impressive than the sheer quantity of microbial diversity is its dynamic nature: microbes are constantly evolving and adapting. 

Our ongoing research tracks evolving microbial populations in real time, using whole-genome and whole-community DNA sequencing to understand their evolution and predict how they adapt to changing environments. For example: 

(1) freshwaters subject to seasonal cyanobacterial blooms,  
(2) the human gut, focusing on cholera infections,  
(3) the evolution and ecology of antibiotic resistance,  
​(4) semi-natural mesocosms at [LEAP](https://qcbs.ca/qcbs-research-showcase?showcase_id=35),  
​(5) genomic epidemiology and pandemic reponse with [CoVaRR-Net] (https://covarrnet.ca).
