![naila]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/pics/naila.jpeg)          | [Na√≠la Barbosa da Costa](https://nailacosta.weebly.com/)<br>Aquatic microbial communities are constantly exposed to a combination of different stressors, usually brought from agricultural lands within the watershed. In my PhD, I studied the impact of commonly-used agrochemicals on bacterioplankton. I worked in collaboration with researchers from McGill University in the LEAP  project to gather experimental data on how freshwater bacteria respond to environmental disturbances at the community, genetic and population level. I also collaborated with the Lake Pulse microbiome research team producing sequencing data of bacterioplankton communities in lakes across Canada with different degrees of human impact.
